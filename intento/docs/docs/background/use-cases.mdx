### Example Use Cases For Protocols

#### Staking protocols

Staking protocols, such as Lido, Swell and EigenLayer, can integrate Intento to automatically restake tokens, providing their users with additional yield. Auto compounding is currently done outside of the protocol's DAO control in vault and escrow smart contracts controlled by protocols that essentially hold custody of the users stake, and depend on bot triggers. Stride, a Cosmos liquid staking Appchain, has built auto-compounding into their solution using a time-based function in their chain. By outsourcing auto compounding calls to the Intent-Centric Automation module, EVM-based staking protocols can now also initiate auto compounding in a non-custodial and trustless manner. This ensures network security and fosters reliability and confidence in the staking protocol.

#### Cross-Chain Asset Management and Coordination

A large digital asset issuer, such as Circle, can integrate Intento to optimize liquidity across fragmented ecosystems so that once tokens are periodically burned on one chain and automatically minted on another chain, using a predictable trigger address. This trust-minimized automation solution can become a key part of the protocol of asset issuers in that it reduces both smart contract risks and counterparty risks.

#### Efficient AMM Strategies

A large EVM-based DEX, such as Uniswap, can integrate Intento so that limit orders and DCA swaps are processed on a reliable basis. Moreover, with the trigger coming from a predictable address coming from Cosmos Hub, Uniswap can allow time-based swap automation without the need for intermediate smart contracts such as vaults and escrow contracts, improving the liquidity position of their users. Furthermore, Concentrated LP tokens can be rebalanced periodically to mitigate impermanent loss. As the trigger is a predictable address, tokens do not need to be locked in a custodial rebalancing protocol. These periodic actions can improve liquidity and allow the protocol to be more stable.

In sum, the Intento module aims to enhance user liquidity and accessibility by enabling instant and secure automation of tokens and assets, eliminating the need for locking them in smart contracts. This improves user experience, increases liquidity, and encourages broader participation. Furthermore, the module facilitates seamless integration of automation with EVM chains, attracting protocols from Ethereum and other EVM-based ecosystems. Protocols can now leverage the benefits of Intento, cross-chain liquidity, and expanded possibilities, both within the Cosmos Ecosystem and across EVM chains, fostering a vibrant and interconnected ecosystem.
